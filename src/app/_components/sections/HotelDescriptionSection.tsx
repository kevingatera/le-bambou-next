            Welcome to the exquisite Le Bambou Gorilla Lodge, strategically
            located near Volcanoes National Park, the magnificent home of rare
            mountain gorillas. Just a short 2.5-hour drive from Kigali
            International Airport and a mere 10-minute drive from the park
            headquarters, our mid-range accommodation is perfect for gorilla
            trekkers. Our lodge offers unparalleled convenience, boasting
            breathtaking panoramic views of Mountain Sabyinyo and the majestic
            Virunga chain of mountains.

            At Le Bambou Gorilla Lodge, we take pride in our 23 self-contained
            private cottages, each adorned with its own cozy fireplace. Designed
            to provide the utmost comfort, our rooms have been meticulously
            crafted using environmentally friendly materials, including locally
            sourced bamboo. Our lodge's allure lies not only in its comfort,
            affordability, and convenience, but also in its dedication to
            sustainability. We work closely with the local community, creating job
            opportunities and fostering cultural exchange. To delight our guests,
            a local cultural dancing troupe showcases Rwanda's vibrant lifestyle
            and rich heritage, promoting sustainable tourism and authentic
            cultural experiences.
